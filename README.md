This repository contains a **high-accuracy image classification model** capable of recognizing various sports activities such as **Badminton, Cricket, Swimming**, and more. The project emphasizes **MLOps best practices**, resolving cross-version serialization issues during deployment from a Kaggle kernel to a cloud runtime.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack & Architecture

The application is built on a modern, open-source stack with specific version constraints for stability.

| Component | Details | Reference |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Model Architecture** | ResNet-34 (Transfer Learning) | [PyTorch ResNet](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/) |
| **Deep Learning Framework** | FastAI | [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) |
| **Runtime Language** | Python 3.11 | [Python](https://www.python.org/) |
| **Inference Framework** | PyTorch | [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) |
| **Web Interface** | Gradio | [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) |

## üì¶ Repository Contents

The repository is organized for **easy reproduction and deployment**.

| File/Folder | Purpose | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `app.py` | **Inference Endpoint** | Initializes Gradio UI and loads the trained model. |
| `model.pkl` | **Trained Model Weights** | FastAI `Learner` object (stored via Git LFS). |
| `requirements.txt` | **Dependency Manifest** | Ensures stable environment by locking versions. |
| `README.md` | **Project Documentation** | Configures Hugging Face Space runtime. |
| `model-deployment.ipynb` | **Training Notebook** | Kaggle notebook with full data preparation & training pipeline. |
| `Example Images` | `.jpg` files | Sample inputs for testing the Gradio interface. |

## üí° MLOps Solution Highlights

The main challenge was **environment incompatibility** between Kaggle (Python 3.11) and Hugging Face Spaces (Python 3.10 by default). This caused:

| Challenge | Error Message | Solution Implemented |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Python Bytecode Incompatibility** | `TypeError: code expected at most 16 arguments, got 18` | Locked Space runtime to Python 3.11 via `README.md` configuration. |
| **Dependency Conflicts** | `ModuleNotFoundError: fasttransform` | Strict version pinning: FastAI `2.7.12`, `numpy<2.0`, ensured all dependencies (`fasttransform`, `cloudpickle`) are in `requirements.txt`. |

‚úÖ This ensures **robust, stable deployment**, independent of environment changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Reproduction

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main [YOUR GITHUB REPO URL]
cd [YOUR GITHUB REPO NAME]
git lfs pull  # Download model.pkl
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application:**

```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio interface will launch in your default browser, ready to classify sports images.
